# EOX FM Mod

A luma layeredfs patch that replaces musics from EOX with their FM versions.

To install, download the version for your region, and simply extract the contents of the zip archive to the root of your SD Card. Make sure that "Enable game patching" is checked in Luma3DS Settings.

# Musics

All tracks in the mod are from the Original Soundtrack CDs instead of from the previous 3DS games. I chose to do it that way because the 3DS remakes actually use the PC-88 versions of the musics instead of the Nintendo DS ones. It also provides a better sound quality when using headphones.

All the tracks in the mod have been manually looped by myself and I edited some of them to add Preemptive Strike/Ambush variations, and while I can guarantee that the mod doesn't crash the game, I didn't fully listen to all of them so some loops may be off. Please contact me on Discord (Jeido#7568) if you find anything that doesn't work as intended.
