# EOX FM Mod

A luma layeredfs patch that replaces musics from EOX with their FM versions.

To install, download the correct version for your region [here](https://github.com/JeidoUran/eox_fm_mod/releases), and simply extract the contents of the zip archive to the root of your SD Card. Make sure that "Enable game patching" is checked in Luma3DS Settings.

# Musics

Most tracks in the mod are from the Original Soundtrack CDs instead of from the previous 3DS games. I chose to do it that way because the 3DS remakes actually use the PC-88 versions of the musics instead of the original Nintendo DS ones. It also provides a better sound quality when using headphones.

All the tracks in the mod have been manually looped by myself, and while I can guarantee that the mod doesn't crash the game, I didn't fully listen to all of the musics so some loops may be off. Please contact me on Discord (Jeido#7568) if you find anything that doesn't work as intended.

Here are the replaced musics:

All Etrian Odyssey ones.
All Etrian Odyssey 2 ones.
All Etrian Odyssey 3 ones.
All Etrian Odyssey 5 ones.
Most of Etrian Odyssey X ones (from Yuzo Koshiro's Youtube channel).

Etrian Odyssey 4 ones and the rest of Etrian Odyssey X are left as is, since there are no FM version of them existing at all.
